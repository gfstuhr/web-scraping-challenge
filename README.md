# web-scraping-challenge
The web-scraping challenge utilized the BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Splinter modules to scape images and other information from several websites. This information then was stored in a MongoDB database.

Using Flask, a web app was created that can call the scrape function and then display the new information on the webpage.
